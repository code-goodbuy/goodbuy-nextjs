[GoodBuy](https://github.com/code-goodbuy/goodbuy-nodejs) frontend app built using nextjs, typescript and tailwindcss.

🚀 Working preview: [goodbuy.vercel.app](https://goodbuy.vercel.app).

## Project Status 🚧

The development of the project is still in progress. Currently we are working on the profile page and on the home page. The social functionalities that will allow the users to follow each other and see each other's acitity are also under development, as well as the scanner functionalities.

## Installation 📦

Prerequisites: `nodejs v15.6.0` or newer and `npm 7.4.0` or newer.

To install this project and run it locally, please follow the following steps:

1. Open the terminal in the desired directory and run `git clone https://github.com/code-goodbuy/goodbuy-nextjs.git`;
2. Navigate to the repository (`cd goodbuy-nextjs`);
3. Navigate to the branch you are interested in (`git checkout BRANCH_NAME`);
4. Install the npm packages by running `npm i `;
5. Either run the development server with `npm run dev` or build and run the app for better performances by running `npm run build && npm run start`;
6. Visit http://localhost:3000.

## Testing 🧪

This app uses Jest, Testing-Library, and Cypress for Unit, Integration, and End-to-End tests.

You can run the Unit and Integration tests by simply running `npm run test`.

If you want to run the End-to-End tests, make sure you build and start the app, then, in another terminal window run either `npm run cy:run` (to run Cypress without its GUI) or `npm run cy:open` (to run Cypress with its GUI).

## Reflection 💭

The goal for this project was to build an MVP for GoodBuy, an app that would store information about the environmental footprint of products and let its users access those information by scanning a product.<br/>
While building what we have so far of the web application, I had the chance to learn some modern technology used in the field such as TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and React with its framework Nextjs.<br/>
I also learned how to build the features listed in the [Current Features](https://github.com/code-goodbuy/goodbuy-nextjs/tree/profile#current-features-) section, often using some third-party libraries and implementing those myself by reading the official documentation.<br/>
During this project, it often felt as I was racing against time, and that was probably the biggest challenge I faced. I did not really overcome this challenge since we do not have an MVP yet, but many of the features left to implement listed in the [Upcoming Features](https://github.com/code-goodbuy/goodbuy-nextjs/tree/profile#upcoming-features-) section should be really easy to implement once their related API endpoint is ready.<br/>
